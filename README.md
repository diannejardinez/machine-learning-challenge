# Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

**Objective**: Create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from NASA Kelper space telescope raw dataset starting at 2009. 


**Background**:

Kepler Space Observatory had verified 1284 new exoplanets as of May 2016. As of October 2017 there are over 3000 confirmed exoplanets total. The raw dataset `exoplanet_data.csv` is a cumulative record of all observed Kepler "objects of interest" â€” basically, all of the approximately 10,000 exoplanet candidates Kepler has taken observations on [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results)



The models below were chosen on the basis of Classification Predictive modeling where class label is predicted for a given example of input data([Source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/#:~:text=Imbalanced%20Classification-,Classification%20Predictive%20Modeling,it%20is%20spam%20or%20not.)). The planets would either confirmed as a new exoplanet  or not.

Fastest run time
- Decision Tree at 5.1 seconds with 216 fits

Slowest run time
- K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) at 29.1 minutes with 28420 fits


There could be a better way at increasing the accuracy for each model by doing more research on the appropriate hyperarameters for Hyperparameter Tuning for each model.


Challenges
- Hyperparameter Tuning model parameters for each model
- Run time for fitting after GridSearchCV
